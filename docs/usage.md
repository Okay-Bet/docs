# How to find People to Bet

Getting started with P2P betting can be challenging, especially if you don't know anyone else participating. Unlike traditional sports books or prediction markets, it's your responsibility to find someone to take the other side of your bet. However, the advantage is that you have the freedom to negotiate your own terms. Let's walk through the process of finding a bet, step by step.

## Sign up and Register a Username

If you haven’t done so yet, head over to [okaybet.fun](https://www.okaybet.fun/) and sign up or log in using your preferred wallet. Next, [set a username](https://docs.okaybet.fun/docs/tutorial-usage/set-a-username) to make it easier for others to place bets with you. While usernames aren’t mandatory, they definitely simplify the process.

## Join a Community

The primary community for Okay Bet is on Discord **[here](https://discord.gg/ptXTA5TeVE)**, which you can join here. If you'd like your own community to integrate with or be featured by Okay Bet, reach out via email to ben@okaybet.fun.

## Make an Offer

Head to the **#betting** channel and post the bet you'd like to make. When betting with someone for the first time, it's best to choose a wager on something easily verifiable online (such as sports, elections, or markets) rather than personal, harder-to-prove bets (like losing 10 pounds). Make sure your offer clearly outlines every aspect of the bet:

- **Conditions:** For example, "Penn State -8.5 vs WVU" means you’re betting on Penn State to win by more than 8.5 points against West Virginia University.
- **Judge:** This is the person who determines the winner of the bet. Ensure they are trustworthy and size your wagers accordingly. For easily provable bets, set **'okaybet'** as the judge, and the project creator will determine the winner. Each community should have its own moderator to help with this. Keep initial wagers small while you familiarize yourself with the process and build trust.
- **Wager:** This is the total amount both sides are betting. All wagers are double or nothing.

## Take an Offer

Go to the #betting channel and explore the bet offers others have posted. If you find an open offer that interests you, start a thread under their post.

### Negotiate

If the terms of a bet are close to what you'd agree to, feel free to negotiate. In the thread, you can counter with your own terms and be ready for a debate. There's no need to play hardball though—both sides get significantly better value compared to traditional betting markets. Learn more about that **[here](https://docs.okaybet.fun/blog/nate-silver-sports-betting)**. 

## Accept the terms 

Once both parties agree on the terms, it's time to head to [okaybet.fun](https://www.okaybet.fun/) to finalize the wager. It’s recommended that the one that made the offer creates the bet with the agreed upon terms. Follow the [tutorial](https://docs.okaybet.fun/docs/category/tutorial) on creating and funding bets for step-by-step instructions. After the Maker sets up and funds the bet, the Taker must either fund it or cancel. Once the bet is fully funded, both bettors should notify the judge in the thread that the action is live.

## Settling the Bet

xOnce a wager is locked, only the judge can declare the winner. After the decision is made, the winner receives their funds immediately. It’s essential to choose a judge you and the community trust.
